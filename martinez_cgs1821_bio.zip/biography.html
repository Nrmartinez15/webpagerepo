<h1>Biography</h1>
<div class="intro">
<p3> Hi, my name is Nathan. I grew up in central Florida. This is my first year at IRSC and it has had a great impression on me. I am a 23-year-old prior veteran. I served in Japan for three years. I am now pursuing a degree in computer information technology.
I thought it would be interesting to take this class so I can have a little bit of background knowledge on how websites are developed.</p3>
